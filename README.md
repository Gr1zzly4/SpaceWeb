 # SpaceWebTask
 Result of my task for "WebTask"

## The purpose of the task
It is necessary to write a class (or several classes within the same namespace) that will implement the mechanism of interaction with the API (sending requests and processing responses). It is also necessary to implement two methods of interaction:
1. getting a token
2. adding an arbitrary domain to an account
To receive the token, you must use the username and password you received when registering your account on https://sweb.ru/hosting / (it will come to the specified email)
You can add an arbitrary domain in the .ru zone (for example, a159014db5dc1.ru )
